                <p>Android, a Google company, is the world’s most popular mobile operating system, with over <a href="http://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp">85% of the world’s market share</a>. Android encourages openness and most of the source code is open source. Android is a platform that thrives on the idea that users should have it their way. Android stresses customizability and personalization. While Google would prefer people to use Android, they also make their software available on other platforms. Android Studio, the app developing software, is available on not just Windows, but also OSX and Linux. Many Google apps are also available on iOS, such as Hangouts and Duo.</p>

                <h2>My Strengths and Abilities</h2>
                <p>I’ve been working with Android for four years and I have multiple apps published on the Google Play Store. I have experience with a variety of apps ranging from tip calculators to indoor locators. I can create highly customizable apps that have different themes and colors, work with different languages, and adapt to any screen. I can also work with AppCompat to target older versions of Android while maintaining many of the new features. I also have experience with permissions, using device hardware, and many of the common libraries.</p>

            <p>I am a second year student at RIT majoring in Software Engineering. In my free time I enjoy learning new concepts and playing with new tech. I make Android apps, experiment with virtual and augmented reality, and create web apps. I have been developing for Android for about four years and web for a year.</p>
