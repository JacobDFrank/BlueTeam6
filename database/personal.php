                <h1>What Are Databases?</h1>
                <p>
                    Databases to put in the simplest terms is the collection of data stored into a system in way that is organized so that can be found quickly and efficiently once you learn the language. Many languages include Oracle, MsSQL, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. We will be focusing more on MySQL as it is the easiest (in my opinion) to get comfortable with when learning databases. Although there are difefferent languages they all share common commands such as SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE. We will learn more about these throughout the various tutorials.

                <h2>My Strengths and Abilities</h2>
                <p>I have been working with database languages for about 3 years now. I think what I love most about them is getting to organize everything in a nice clean way that makes sense. I tend to be someone who likes to keeps things organized, so it's fitting for me to enjoy working with databases. Alongside keeping things organized I work well with groups and pull well more than my own weight. In my spare time I like to stay active by being in the running club and pushing myself to new feats. </p>

            <p>I am a fourth your RIT student majoring in Information Technology. I have experience in a varity of subjects ranging from Java to HTML to Database programming. Whatever you need I can most likely get the job done for you. Im always up for learning new languages for the fun of it because I believe you can always learn something new everyday.</p>
