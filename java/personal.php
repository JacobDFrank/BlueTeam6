                <h1>What is Java?</h1>
                <p>Java is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world! In the following sections, I will be educating you on the history and the practical uses of the language.</p>
                <h3>Who Created Java?</h3>
                <!--Java Caveman Image-->
                <p>Created by James Gosling and released by Sun Microsystems in 1995, JAVA is a high-level programming language that prides itself on being able to be written once and run anywhere (WORA). 21 years later and millions of lines of code later, Java is the most popular programming language in the world. According to PYPL (Source:http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) , Java tutorials are the most frequent programming tutorials searched on Google, with 23.6% of all searches.

                <h3>Why Use Java?</h3>
                <!--Coffee Cup Image -->
                <p>Java programming is known as Object Oriented Programming (OOP). To understand Objects, think about a person. A person has a first name, last name, phone number, email, etc. Just as you would save all of this information, Java saves this information in a similar way. Each object belongs to a Class- the template in which function are programmed on top of and then referenced when needed. Saving all of the information in Objects allows for classes to easily communicate with each other to share information. Think of this as two people talking, they trade information by asking questions and receiving answers. The goal of Java programmers is to think of the questions that are going to be asked and to let the Objects to respond with the answers that we need.</p>
                <h3>What uses Java</h3>
                <p>Java whether you know it or not, is being used by many items in your daily life. Everything from Netflix to your cell phone run Java to share information. According to Java’s website (Source: https://go.java/index.html) there are 1.1 billion desktop applications run Java, 930 million Java Runtime Environment downloads each year, 3 billion mobile phones that run Java, as well as all Blu-Ray players and ATM’s. Note: No iPhones support Java. The devices that use Java is ever expanding as the language is very adaptable.</p>

I really enjoyed how he presented the information to us. I thought it was presented in a way that made it simple to understand and easy to see how it all correlated. Even the quiz on his site was phenomenal! I feel so much more secure now knowing how to protect some applications as well as how to find vulnerable, unsafe applications.” - Kelsey C.</p>

                <p>Cybersecurity itself is an expansive field; there is a lot to it. There is physical security, network security, computer security, Internet of Things device security, message security and more. My overview on security will go through a few of the fields in which I am most proficient in (Network and application security) as well as a field which I have a lot of interest in (pentesting). I have worked almost exclusively in the network security field but have spent some time working on application security. Penetration testing is a bit new to me but I have friends who have done it and I have dabbled a bit in it. If you are looking to get started in any of these fields feel free to contact me and I can help get you started!</p>

            <h2>Whoami?</h2>
            <p>I am a third year student at RIT majoring in Computing Security. Throughout my time here at RIT, I have continually expanded my knowledge in cybersecurity by completing work in various fields related to cybersecurity. Both of my two summer internships have resulted in me gaining knowledge and skill with network security. Those summers, I worked with the security team to watch the network and monitor what entered and left our network. While at school, I have engaged in some penetration testing style events called Capture the Flag challenges (CTFs). These challenges are presented to you and you need to exploit it in a certain way while maintaining the integrity of the challenge (so that others can work on it). This is similar to pentesting in the sense that you are told to attack the network but you cannot destroy or dismantle it. Outside of security, I am involved in Ultimate Disc as it is my sport of choice. If I am not busy with disc or security, you can probably find me relaxing in my room as I play videogames to wind down a bit.</p>
